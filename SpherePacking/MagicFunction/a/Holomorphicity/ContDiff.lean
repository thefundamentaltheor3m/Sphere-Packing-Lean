/-! # Smoothness

In this file, we prove that the integrands of all of the REAL integrals making up a are smooth. That
is, we translate the complex holomorphicity results into smoothness results by showing first that
the parametrisations are smooth and then composing them with the holomorphicity proofs to conclude
that the composition of the complex integrands with the parametrisations are smooth real functions.
