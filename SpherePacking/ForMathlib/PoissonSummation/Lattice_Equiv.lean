/-! # ℤ-Linear Equivalences of Lattices with `ℤ^n`.

In this file, we prove that there is a ℤ-linear equivalence of any lattice in Euclidean Space with
the standard lattice ℤ^n (as defined in `SpherePacking.ForMathlib.PoissonSummation.Zn_Pi`).

/- The point of the above is that we now have an element of GLₙ(ℤ) using which we can identify any
lattice with ℤ^n, the canonical free ℤ-submodule of the Euclidean space ℝ^n. This includes their
dual lattices, which we have shown to be lattices in
`SpherePacking.ForMathlib.PoissonSummation.DualLattice`. This is a crucial
step in the reduction of the general Poisson Summation Formula to the case where we only deal with
the canonical lattice ℤ^n. -/

-- It'd be nice to show that the covolume of Λ is the determinant of its `Zn_equiv`.
