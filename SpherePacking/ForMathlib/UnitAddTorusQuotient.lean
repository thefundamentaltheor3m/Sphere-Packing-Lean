/-! # The quotient map `(ι → ℝ) → (ℝ/ℤ)^ι` presenting the unit torus

For an index type `ι`, the coordinatewise quotient map `coeFun ι : (ι → ℝ) → UnitAddTorus ι`
presents the `ι`-dimensional unit torus `(ℝ/ℤ)^ι` as a quotient of `ℝ^ι`. We record its
continuity, that it is an open quotient map, and the value of the Fourier monomials `mFourier k`
on its image.

We also record the pull-back of Haar integration on the torus to a fundamental cube
`∏ i, (t, t+1] ⊆ ℝ^ι`. Mathlib already proves this, more generally, as
`UnitAddTorus.integral_preimage` — but that lemma is stated under a file-`local` measure-space
instance `⟨AddCircle.haarAddCircle⟩` on `UnitAddCircle`, which differs (by a defeq-trivial `1 •`)
from the global `AddCircle.measureSpace 1` that this project's torus integrals use, so it is not a
drop-in. We therefore keep our own version against the global instance; at upstreaming time, once
the instances are reconciled, it is subsumed by `UnitAddTorus.integral_preimage`.

This is a companion to `Mathlib.Analysis.Fourier.AddCircleMulti` (which defines `UnitAddTorus`,
`mFourier`, and `mFourierCoeff`).

Upstream note: `coeFun ι` is definitionally `Pi.map (fun _ => QuotientAddGroup.mk)` (the coercion
`(· : UnitAddCircle)` is `QuotientAddGroup.mk`), and `mFourier_apply_coeFun` is a single-`simp`
unfolding; on upstreaming `coeFun` would be inlined and these lemmas folded into
`Mathlib/Analysis/Fourier/AddCircleMulti.lean`. They are kept here as the project-local quotient
API on which `PoissonSummationGeneral.lean` builds.
