-- *THIS LEMMA IS WRONG! Eg. constant function ℕ → ℝ : n ↦ 1 / 2*
-- -- This has nothing to do with the fact that the product exists because if it's not
-- -- multipliable, the product is 1. So, we just need to show that all the terms are positive.

* Tprod le tprod under nonnegativity assumption, without OrderedCommMonoid
* Tprod positive: make a specific aux lemma for the one we want
