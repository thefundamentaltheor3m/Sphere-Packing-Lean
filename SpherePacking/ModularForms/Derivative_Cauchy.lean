# Cauchy Estimates for Modular Forms

This file provides the infrastructure for using Cauchy estimates to bound derivatives
of holomorphic functions on the upper half plane.

## Main results

* `diffContOnCl_comp_ofComplex_of_mdifferentiable`: Bridge from `MDifferentiable` on ℍ
  to `DiffContOnCl` on disks in ℂ contained in the upper half plane.
* `closedBall_center_subset_upperHalfPlane`: Geometric lemma showing `closedBall z (z.im/2)`
  is contained in the upper half plane.
* `norm_D_le_of_sphere_bound`: Cauchy estimate for D-derivative: if f is holomorphic on a
  disk and bounded by M on the sphere, then `‖D f z‖ ≤ M / (2πr)`.
* `D_isBoundedAtImInfty_of_bounded`: D-derivative is bounded at infinity for bounded
  holomorphic functions.

/-- If `f : ℍ → ℂ` is `MDifferentiable` and a closed disk in `ℂ` lies in the upper
half-plane, then `f ∘ ofComplex` is `DiffContOnCl` on the corresponding open disk. -/

/-! ## Cauchy Estimates -/

/-- Cauchy estimate for the D-derivative: if `f ∘ ofComplex` is holomorphic on a disk
of radius `r` around `z` and bounded by `M` on the boundary sphere,
then `‖D f z‖ ≤ M / (2πr)`.

This is the core estimate used by `D_isBoundedAtImInfty_of_bounded`. -/

/-- The D-derivative is bounded at infinity for bounded holomorphic functions.

For y large (y ≥ 2*max(A,0) + 1), we use a ball of radius z.im/2 around z.
The ball lies in the upper half plane, f is bounded by M on it, and
`norm_D_le_of_sphere_bound` gives ‖D f z‖ ≤ M/(π·z.im) ≤ M/π. -/
